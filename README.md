# What is in this repository?

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for DH 140 Assignment 4. In this particular Jupyter notebook (Assignment04.ipynb) originally authored 
by Yoh Kawano of UCLA's Office for Advanced Research Computing, I have made some changes to certain parts of the notebook. Throughout the notebook, 
you will be exploring a particular geojson file, analyzing the data within, and creating plots from that data. The plots contained in this notebook include chloropeth maps (certain regions are colored based on a statistic such as percent of people that are Non-Hispanic Black), adding plots over basemaps, and plots showing different census tracts.
